# MindGame

The project is a 32-electrode EPOC FLEX EEG signal interpreter using artificial intelligence to play a game by mind.

## How does it work?

![Emotiv](https://cdn-bhgin.nitrocdn.com/fYiCbyekuWxdwsIavStGyhFBtSFZmwkM/assets/static/optimized/rev-f33305f/uploads/2018/06/flex-kit-510x510.jpeg)

Installing the headset generally takes about 30 minutes to an hour during which we apply the gel on each electrode.

The EEG signals are transmitted wirelessly to the Emotiv software which displays each signal's stability:

After the installation is done and the connectivity averages 100%, we can begin the EEG session.

The signals can either be recorded and worked with later or streamed in real time.

After the recording session, we spend about one hour and a half cleaning up the kit.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The project is powered by the following libraries:

- [pylsl](https://github.com/chkothe/pylsl)
